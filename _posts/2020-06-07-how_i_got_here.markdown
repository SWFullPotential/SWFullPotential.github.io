<p>     My name is Samantha and I want to tell you a little bit about how I got to where I am in my journey of life. Growing up I spent my life doing construction with my father. Of course, that was just part-time as a kid. I decided to work with him full-time as an adult and spent two years remodeling homes. It as a lot of fun and I am so grateful for the knowledge I obtained during that time. However, my soul desired more freedom and I was itching to move somewhere new and begin a new adventure.  </p>

<p>     I ended up moving across the country to live with my sister in Florida. After leaving everything behind and making the big move, my sister decided to leave Florida and that began the biggest journey I had experienced thus far in my life. Living on my own with no family anywhere nearby. I was terrified of not making things work so I took whatever job I could, just so I could stay and make things work. I wanted so badly to go to school for something but did not think I had the means or ability to because of work. Fortunately, at this time I met my now-husband. Once we got engaged he told me, “his wife would have at LEAST a Bachelors”.  </p>

<p>     Thus began my education journey. I began school right away but had no idea what I wanted to do. I started with interior design because I had creative tendencies and I loved working in the construction field, but that didn’t work out for me. I took some time off of my degree and went to school for Cosmetology. It was a lot of fun and I immediately got my Cosmetology License as soon as I finished school. Of course, as soon as I finished cosmetology school, I immediately jumped back into working on my degree. I worked at salons and went to school. I first obtained my Associate's Degree in Business Admin and then finally completed my Bachelor's in Marketing in 2019.  </p>

<p>     With all of that education under my belt, you’d think I would just go get a job and be done with it all, however, that was not the case. Again, my soul yearned for another adventure.  </p>

<p>     My husband and I have been very fortunate to be able to travel and vacation several times throughout our relationship. I’ve always had this desire to travel the world and this desire was getting stronger and more intense. I didn’t want to just go on a trip every once in a while. I wanted to be able to pick a place, go, and stay as long as we wanted. To do this we need an income that would allow us to be mobile and work remotely. I knew that doing hair was definitely not that. This began my search into working and living remotely.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>     Naturally, I immediately went to google. I signed up for several job sites and looked only for remote work. This is where I ran into a problem. 95% of the truly remote jobs were in the tech industry. An industry I had absolutely NO experience in. This could have stopped me, and I know several people who would have quit at this point, but instead, I decided to look into the industry and see if maybe, just maybe it could be for me.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>     I searched various places and looked for ways to break into the industry or even just test it out. I was fortunate enough to stumble upon “The Odin Project”. Through this free website, I was able to begin lessons towards becoming a full-stack developer. As I worked my way through the lessons I saw that I would be able to use both my logical and creative sides. This excited me and pushed me to research further. The Odin Project is wonderful, but I knew I needed something more structured for me to enter this new industry as quickly as possible.  </p>

<p>     I kept searching and came upon an app called “Career Karma” which is specifically designed to help people research, apply, and get into a “Bootcamp” that will teach me to become a Software Developer. I jumped right in and began looking into different schools and what they offered. I interviewed at several different schools and they all asked the same thing. Why are you interested in Software Development? My answer was always the same: I want to travel the world and live abroad for at least a year and I need a career that will allow me to do that while at the same time allow me to express creativity and logic at the same time. Software Development is the path I have chosen and I am so excited for the journey that is to come. </p>
