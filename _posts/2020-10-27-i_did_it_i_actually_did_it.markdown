<p>After finishing my Bachelor's degree in May 2019, I knew right away that I needed to do something else. I had been working in the hair industry since 2012, had owned my own business, and was completely burned out. After taking a much needed month-long break, I began on a path of searching for a new career while still doing hair. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started by getting  an ESOL certification so that I could remotely teach English, but after working in the field decided that it just wasn't for me. So the search continued. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>For years my husband has always called me his "IT guy" and one day something clicked and a light came on to look into the tech industry. I had a brother that had entered the field some years before and a sister that had dabbled in learning some coding languages. I asked questions, did some research, and finally decided to test it out. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I began my journey with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>. I didn't need to get very far before realizing I very much enjoyed coding and began searching for ways of learning how to become a developer in a more structured environment. I found <a href="https://careerkarma.com">Career Karma</a> and began their #21DayChallenge to get started and find a Bootcamp that would work for me. I interviewed several schools, asked a ton of questions, and decided that Flatiron School, though seemingly very difficult, would be the best fit for me. I applied, was quickly accepted, and began their Bootcamp Prep Course. </p>

<p>During my research I realized that I would be mentally challenged in a way I had never experienced before. My time would be completely consumed by my studies and I would not be able to work if I were going to do full-time, as I had planned. My husband and I decided that during the time I was in school and until I found a job we would live with my sister. This meant we were moving cross country the week before school started. Talk about a stressful couple of weeks!!! After a lot of hard work, my husband is a MACHINE, we made it safely to our new temporary home and I began the ride of a lifetime. </p>

<p><strong>The First Mile</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first section of the Bootcamp course is called "The First Mile". It seems so long ago now and went by so fast, that I barely remember everything we did. There were so many assignments to do, so much information to learn, and such a short time to complete it all in. It is purposely difficult. If students cannot keep up mentally and complete all the requirements, then the school knows that the full-time program is not for that student. I was determined to win so I fought my not yet developed abilities and negative thoughts. I remember days when I would just stare at my computer screen and not understand a single word that was on it. Fortunately, the school offers you an educational coach. Mine happened to be Katie McKenna. I reached out to her during a time of need and she gave me some advice that stuck with me throughout my entire time at Flatiron. "Walk away from the computer". Now, of course, she didn't mean permanently, just take the rest of the day off, have a break. I was struggling to understand everything and fighting not to get behind, but I had reached an overload point. She said it would be ok and that what I truly needed was to take a break and try again the following day. I very reluctantly did what she said, and as it turned out I didn't really end up behind. I was able to get back to things with a clear head the next day and get all caught up. That was the only time I reached out to her, but I will forever be grateful for her advice. I used it more than once throughout the rest of the course. </p>

<p><strong>Projects and Live Reviews</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were five modules during the course and at the end of each one was a final project followed by a live review. The projects were meant to test us. We have to prove that we understood what we had just learned by creating some sort of app applying that language or framework. There were times when the projects came easily and only some help was needed, and other times when I felt like I had no idea what to do. I both looked forward to and almost was scared of projects. I was nervous because I was uncertain of myself, but excited because I knew that I would complete the project and be proud of what I had accomplished. After every project had been completed I was always so excited to show my family what I had done, even though most of them didn't understand. </p>

<p>In order to pass each module, we had to pass the live review that followed the project. This was probably the most terrifying, challenging part of the entire program for me. Not only did the reviews consist of being questioned about the code you had written, but you also have to live code something of the reviewer's choice. Trying to prepare for those was always difficult for me. I mean, how do you prepare to live code when you have NO idea what type of things the reviewer might ask for? I learned after my first review that physically writing down notes as I went through my lessons and making flashcards was extremely valuable when it came to the reviews. Another thing I learned was, meeting up with other students to talk about code was VITAL to the success of these reviews. It is also a good idea to practice adding various features to your project in a practice branch (not your master branch) so that you can get used to coding different new features. Working with students when practicing this type of coding is also helpful. I have a few students I will forever be grateful for who helped me throughout my time at Flatiron. Not only did they help me, but I had the opportunity to help them. Any time I noticed I was helping someone, it boosted my confidence and made the reviews just a little bit easier. The reviews are meant to get harder as they go, but again that is by design. The reason for this is that they are trying to prepare you for the technical interviews you will be going through when the job search begins. As I begin that new phase I am grateful for the challenges I have faced in the live reviews. </p>

<p><strong>The Final Review</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can't believe I'm at the end already. I feel like I just started yet that feels so long ago at the same time. The final module was extremely difficult and had two frameworks to learn instead of the usual one. There was so much information and when project week began I felt totally unprepared. I utilized articles, students, and my instructor to get through building out the idea I had for my final project. By the time the week was over I did not know up from down, I struggled to speak coherent sentences, and honestly, I had no idea what day it was. My project was completed, but I wasn't sure I really knew what I had just done. It worked, but how? Thus began the task of preparing for my final live review. I read over docs from the framework website, I read over all my notes, I read over the lessons again. I met with other students, I met with my instructor. We talked code, I answered questions, I gave suggestions and the night before the review I finally felt like I might be ready. Was I nervous? OH YEAH. A cohort lead I spoke to referred to my reviewer as the Gandalf of reviewers.... you know, "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" (not that she is mean, just very thorough).  So yeah, you could say I was nervous. </p>

<p>I spent the morning working with other students, practicing some coding, and spent some time reading over my notes one last time. I meditated a bit and reminded myself to breathe. "I know this stuff, and I can figure it out". As the review began, I easily flowed through my code, explaining things as I went, and answering any questions she had. I reminded myself to think and explained my thought process to the reviewer any time I got stuck and ended up answering all her questions correctly. It was so exciting to hear her keep mentioning how thorough I was with each answer, and how clear it was that I knew my stuff and obviously studied. Finally, we came to the live coding portion. My fingers were crossed so tightly that she would ask me to code one of the things I had practiced before. Never in a review before had the reviewer actually asked me to code something I had practiced, but FINALLY, I'd hit the jackpot! She asked me to live code for her a like button which surprisingly I had just figured out how to do minutes before the review!!! I was so excited that I didn't have to google anything, but instead was able to walk through my thought process and code out the like button how she wanted it. After I finished coding she asked me a few more questions which again, I answered with ease.  All in all, I passed my final review for my Flatiron Bootcamp and can now say that I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer!</p>

<p>I am so grateful for everything I have experienced during this time. I am very grateful for my patient husband who has been mostly without me during this time. For my family for allowing us into their home, for feeding us most of the time, and supporting my journey. I am grateful for the students in my class who pushed and encouraged me along that way, and the reviewers who kept me on my toes. And finally, I am so deeply grateful for Enoch Griffith, my cohort lead and instructor. Without him, I would not have learned so well and would not have believed in myself as much as I do now when it comes to code. Thank you for everything, you've created yet another Software Engineer! I look forward to beginning a new position in this industry and thriving in my new career! </p>
